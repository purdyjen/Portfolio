    <article>
        <p>My name is Jennifer Purdy, but most people call me Jenna. I graduated from Texas A&M University - College Station in 2010
            with a BA in English and Theatre Arts and from Duke Divinity School in 2015 with a Master of Divinity. After graduation,
            I served as an Associate Pastor at First United Methodist Church in La Grange, TX for two years before being appointed
            as the Senior Pastor at First United Methodist Church in Port Isabel, TX.</p>
        <p>While I have loved serving in ministry, a little over a year ago I felt the need to make a change
            and pursue a different career path. I've always had a natural affinity for technology and a vague interest in learning to code,
            so I decided to do some research and look into it. The more I learned, the more excited I became. I enjoy challenging myself
            and learning new things, which makes coding perfect for me because there is no shortage of new skills to learn.</p>
        <p>I was born with a severe to profound hearing loss in both ears, but received my first pair of hearing aids at 15 months.
            I attended pre-school at Sunshine Cottage for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing in San Antonio, TX for a year before being
            mainstreamed into kindergarten. I continued speech therapy until third grade and then I was done. 
            I speak well enough that most people can't tell that I'm Hard of Hearing.</p>
        <p>I currently live alone with my two cats: Chico
            and Ignatius Batcat Westley (Iggy); I may or may not be guilty of taking an inordinate amount of photos of them.</p>
